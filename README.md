# Minimum Value Finder

This Dart program finds the minimum value in a list of integers, which can contain both positive and negative numbers. It demonstrates the use of list operations, a custom function, and the `forEach` method for processing the list elements.

## 📋 Features

- **🗂️ List Creation**: Initializes a list containing positive and negative integers.
- **🔄 Iterative Comparison**: Uses the `forEach` method to compare each element with the current minimum value.
- **🧮 Custom Function**: Implements a `getMin` function to encapsulate the logic for finding the smallest number in the list.
- **📊 Dynamic Output**: Dynamically calculates and outputs the minimum value.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. Open the Dart file (`main.dart`) in your preferred Dart editor or IDE.
3. **Run the program** to see the minimum value in the predefined list.

## 📄 Example Output

```plaintext

### 📝 Customization
- You can modify the `numbers` list in the Dart file to include your own set of integers.
- The program will dynamically find and display the minimum value for the new list.

Happy coding! 🎉
